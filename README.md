# Vehicle-Count-Predictor
A machine learning model that predicts urban traffic congestion levels using time-based and vehicle count data collected by a computer vision system.
This project focuses on predicting **vehicle counts** using core **machine learning regression techniques**. The workflow involved detailed **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to understand feature distributions, followed by **data cleaning and preprocessing** to handle missing values and ensure consistency. Further improvements were made through **feature scaling** and **feature engineering**, where time-based variables like “Hour” were transformed into **cyclical features** using **sine and cosine encoding** to help models better capture temporal relationships.

Three regression models — **Random Forest Regressor**, **XGBoost Regressor**, and **Linear Regression** - were trained and evaluated using metrics such as **R² Score**, **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**, and **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**. Among them, the **Random Forest Regressor** achieved the best performance with an R² of 0.78, outperforming the others in both accuracy and stability. The project highlights the importance of **feature engineering**, **model selection**, and **data preprocessing** in improving predictive performance within regression-based systems.
